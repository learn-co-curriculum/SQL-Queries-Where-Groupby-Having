## Teacher Notes

## Summary

This is a set of useful practice exercises for students to test their SQL knowledge of filtering datasets. Problems also require students to use group by statements and having clauses. The final exercise is a real stretch, involving datetime functions which students are apt to have no previous exposure to. Encourage students to actively problem solve as they would on the job by using search engines and other online resources.

## Learning Goals
* Perform simple select statements with SQL
* Use where clauses appropriately with SQL
* Understand the difference between where and having clauses
* Perform group by aggregations with sql

## Prerequisite Knowledge
